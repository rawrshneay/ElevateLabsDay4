Task 4 : Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux

First i make sure i have installed ufw on linux.

After that, i list the current firewall rules.

sudo ufw enable
Activates the UFW firewall.
Ensures it starts automatically at system boot.
Output confirms the firewall is now active.

sudo ufw status numbered
Displays the current firewall rules with rule numbers.
Output shows: Status: active (but no rules yet).

sudo ufw deny 23
Adds a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23, used by Telnet.
Two rules are added:
One for IPv4: Rule added
One for IPv6: Rule added (v6)

telnet localhost 23
Tries to connect to Telnet service on the local machine (port 23).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288ae723-f50d-4d9c-937d-036f4efb4206)

Result:
Connection refused from both ::1 (IPv6) and 127.0.0.1 (IPv4).
This means:
Either no Telnet server is running, or
The firewall rule is successfully blocking the connection.

sudo ufw status numbered
Lists all active firewall rules with their rule numbers.
Output shows:
[1] 23 DENY IN Anywhere
[2] 23 (v6) DENY IN Anywhere (v6)
This means port 23 is blocked for both IPv4 and IPv6.
Im listing it out to delete the rule based on the index number.

sudo ufw delete 1
Deletes rule number 1, which blocks port 23 for IPv4.

Prompt: Proceed with operation (y|n)?
You entered y â†’ Rule deleted successfully.

sudo ufw status numbered 
Rechecks current firewall rules.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b8dcae-d25f-45d6-982f-b0ecc61bf47e)

Output now shows only:
[1] 23 (v6) DENY IN Anywhere (v6)
IPv4 rule is successfully removed, but IPv6 rule still exists.

How a Firewall Filters Work:
A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks like the internet.
Firewalls use rules to decide whether to allow or block specific traffic.
How Filtering Works
Allow rules: Permit traffic on specific ports or from specific IP addresses.
Deny rules: Block traffic on certain ports or from specified IP addresses.
Inbound filtering: Controls traffic coming into the system.
Outbound filtering: Controls traffic leaving the system (less commonly used in UFW by default).
Rules are processed in the order they are listed; the first match is applied.
